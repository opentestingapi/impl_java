# System Tests

We will use OpenTestingApi to test OpenTestingApi - isn't it cool? Declaration instead of implementation!

See resources/opentesting/systemtests

Dear Podman Users:
* default is Docker (most Pipelines still use Docker)
* please add host.testcontainers.internal to /etc/hosts
* set DOCKER_HOST as unix:///run/user/1001/podman/podman.sock (see beforeAll method)
