## local tests

In addition to running as a JUnit test case, the tests can also be uploaded and run directly.
To do this, the open testing container must be started in the DevEnv (network=host) and the application must be running.

File upload (please use the correct sed command in the script):
./uploadTestCase.sh  systemtests/test001/

Trigger the inject manually:
curl http://localhost:50000/trigger/inject/test001/inject-rest-1
